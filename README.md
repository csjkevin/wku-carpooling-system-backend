# WKU Carpooling System Backend

This is the repository for a senior capstone project - WKU Carpooling System.

The project is frontend and backend separated. This repository is for the backend of the system.

Find the frontend of the system [here](https://github.com/csjkevin/wku-carpooling-system-frontend).

## Getting Started

### Install Project Dependencies

The app relies on many packages. You need to install dependencies before starting the project.

The packages of the project is managed by npm (Node Package Manager) or other node package manager such as yarn, pnpm, etc. You can install the packages by running:

`npm install`

If you have Node.js installed in your system, you should have the command of npm. If not, you can check [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Install Relied Services

The app relies on the following services:

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org): To keep the persistent data such as users, orders, etc. You can use MySQL, too.
* [Redis](https://redis.io): To keep the temporary data such as cache, session, etc.

You need to install them before starting the project.

### Set Environment Variables

The app relies on the following information:

* Database name, username and password: Used for database connection.
* WKU email address and password: Used to send notification emails such as user registration, order updates, etc. The email address should be of WKU since the emails are delivered to WKU users.
* Root URL of the backend: For example, if an API is accessed through `http://localhost:7001/example`, then `http://localhost:7001` is the web root. It was used in sending the emails which contains the URL to the server.
* WeChat Work robot key (Optional): Used to push notifications to the designated WeChat Work group. Check out [here](https://developer.work.weixin.qq.com/document/path/91770) for more details. If your webhook address is `https://qyapi.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/webhook/send?key=693a91f6-7xxx-4bc4-97a0-0ec2sifa5aaa`, then `693a91f6-7xxx-4bc4-97a0-0ec2sifa5aaa` is the value you should set on the environment variable.
* Feishu robot webhook id (Optional): Used to push notifications to the designated Feishu group. Check out [here](https://open.feishu.cn/document/ukTMukTMukTM/ucTM5YjL3ETO24yNxkjN) for more details. If your webhook address is `https://open.feishu.cn/open-apis/bot/v2/hook/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`, then `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` is the value you should set on the environment variable.

Some of them are secret and should not appear in the source code. Some of them vary in deployment. Thus, we should set them as environment variables.

To set the environment variables, run:

```
export WKU_CARPOOLING_SYSTEM_DB_USER=your_database_username
export WKU_CARPOOLING_SYSTEM_DB_PASS=your_database_password
export WKU_CARPOOLING_SYSTEM_DB_NAME=your_database_name
export WKU_CARPOOLING_SYSTEM_EMAIL_USER=your_wku_email_address
export WKU_CARPOOLING_SYSTEM_EMAIL_PASS=your_wku_email_password
export WKU_CARPOOLING_SYSTEM_WEBROOT=the_root_url_of_the_backend
export WKU_CARPOOLING_SYSTEM_WECHATWORK_WEBHOOK_KEY=your_wechat_work_robot_key
export WKU_CARPOOLING_SYSTEM_FEISHU_WEBHOOK_ID=your_feishu_robot_webhook_id
```

So the app can access them from `process.env`.

## Development

To start the server in the development mode, run:

`npm run dev`

Access the APIs through [http://localhost:7001](http://localhost:7001).

The server will restart when you make changes.

## Deployment

To start the server in the production mode, run:

`npm start`

## Collaboration & Contribution Guideline

### Code Style

The code style must be unified with the project. If `prettier` is effective in the project, the code will be automatically formatted to the unified format defined in `.preitterrc`.

### Commit Message

The commit message must be in the following format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory, the `(<scope>)` field is optional.

The type must be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (examples: CircleCi, SauceLabs)
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
